# Final Project

## Introduction
In this project I used some Python libraries to do Web Scraping, Dashboards and manipulate data. The project was a test to finish the course "Python Project for Data Science" on Coursera all the course is made by IBM professionals.

## Explaining the code
During the test some questions were asked that must be answered through lines of code. First of all, I will explain the libraries that were used and why they were used. The Pandas library was used to analyze the data on the websites, the other library used was Yahoo Finance, which serves to read the financial information from the code. NumPy, on the other hand, was for doing some mathematical operations, Requests is for making requests, as the name implies. Beautiful Soup serves to read the data in HTML and transform them into Python code, and finally, MatPlotLib that created the graphs through codes and tables.
Through the questions that are in the lines of code, it facilitates the understanding of you, readers.
